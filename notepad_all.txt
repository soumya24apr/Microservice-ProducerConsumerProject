GIT helping point to revert to previous version ---------------------
you can cmd into your code directory and run git commands there... git show-ref you can run there and it gets you the hashes for all the branch in the local repo

Microservice

assembly and deploy 
scalabale and independent 

Eureka Server - get registry - register - send heartbeat 

Eureka Heartbeat - default timing is 30 sec and can be customised in bootstrap.properties file ( try making it work ) --health check example 

Eureka client - register application instances 

Spring cloud hystrix - library for enabling resilience in microservices - continuosly watching 
supported design pattern - failover method -- it periodically send request to see if application is down.

circuit breakers 

---------------

netflix has infra on aws - communicate via API
zuul 
eureka
ribbon
spring cloud - collection of tools from pivotal 
Spring cloud acts as a scaffolding for microservices - includes netflix 00S

smart wrapper in a way of different annotion
---------------
Questions

How do u share data in microservices?
soa were the services which would be provided to another component. It can be loosely coupled and independent of other component. So what is the difference od SOA & microservices?
if i dont have ci/cd in my microservices would it be the same.
multiple instance of that modules in microservices . how can we do it technically

what is api gateway ? zuul
Ribbon - load balancing in Client side

when u say services are choreographed , how service 1 will interact to service 3 . as it structured as service 1 = service 2 = service 3= service 4

When we talk about microservices, it means having many and many services, can i not use port and mention application with respect to instances - as it would be tough to get port for multiple application.

Will i have multiple eureka server when we talk about production

actuator - in eureka

-=======================


zero downtime scenario - for microservices

service discovery - eureka

dev ops + microservices

dev checkin code

automated script which will create ec2 instances, docker containers , hosted on ms, 

change in any microservices , how do u deploy the patch , without any delay

---------------

build ec2 and create network - 

deploy the microservices from git 

docker image for microservices -  thru script

------------

on premise -  

------------

On AWS,
install sql server  - add

lets insurance & patient appt service talk to each other -

docker container - 4 
list of VMs, wat we ned to install, next steps which includes infra setup.

Alien Language
Today, we are going to learn a new language. It looks like English, but you will not be able to recognize the words. For example:

Java  Mdyd Python  Sbwkrq

However, with some analysis, we are able to figure out that this language is nothing but English alphabets shifted by a certain offset. For example:

J + 3 = M
a + 3 = d
v + 3 = y
a + 3 = d

Hence, Java  Mdyd.

Similarly, Python  Sbwkrq.

Your task is to create a AlienLanguageTranslator, which can translate English to this new language and vice versa. You are given a prototype LanguageTranslator which lists all functionality the AlienLanguageTranslator should provide.
